# Matt's Portfolio

* I built this website for my older brother's birthday. He's an incredibly talented tattoo artist but didn't have a a portfolio to display his work. 
* I plan to update the website per his career needs.
* It's a simple portfolio website for an artist looking to display his or her work; featuring the following:
    * A toggle menu navbar that adjust to the size of the screen the website is being displayed on.
    * A lightbox image display so, the user can take a better look at and easily navigate through the artwork.
    * A sleek "About" page with a profile picture and a short description of the owner.
    * A footer that is complete with scocial media icon buttons.

Here is some of his work. If you like him, follow him https://www.instagram.com/mtghadban/?hl=en
