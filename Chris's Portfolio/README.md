# Chris's Portfolio

* I built this website for my oldest brother who is applying to business school and wanted to display his diverse skillset / background.
* Furthermore, I used the same design for my other older brother (a tattoo artist) to display his work.
* It's a simple portfolio website for an artist looking to display his or her work; featuring the following:
    -> A toggle menu navbar that adjust to the size of the screen the website is being displayed on.
    -> A lightbox image display so, the user can take a better look at and easily navigate through the artwork.
    -> A sleek "About" page with a profile picture and a short description of the owner.
    -> A footer that is complete with scocial media icon buttons.
