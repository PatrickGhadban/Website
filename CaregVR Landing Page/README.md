# caregiVR Landing Page

* Used HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, PHP, Ajax, & MySQL
* This ia a landing page for the startup caregiVR. The CEO, Jack O'Meara is the nicest man and it was a pleasure to work for him.
* The company creats tools and technologies to make life easier for families and caregivers tending to loved ones living with Alzheimer's and related dementias. The goal of our work is to empower the care team by employing the latest in digital technology, behavioral science, and data analytics to better care for people with dementia. Truly great people working for a noble cause.

* This was a great project to introduce me into the Full-Stack Dev world.
* Website functionality includes:
  * Option to subscribe - emails are stored in a MySQL DB and a responsive email is sent.
  * Cross functionality on browsers & devices
  * Cool (subjectively), animated buttons that scroll the use from the top page to the subscription page at the bottom.
  
 * To view the final design watch the final draft here. Also, the third draft displays the subscription functionality nicely.
