# Websites

* I'm interested in learning more about the Full-Stack Dev world; particularly, front end, since I have some backend experience. So, I designed, built, and freelanced some websites for friends, family and a startup (caregivr) to get my feet wet. 
* Used HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, PHP, Ajax, MySQL, & Bootstrap.
*  At the moment, my projects include:
    * A landing page for the startup caregivr.
    * A simple portfolio website for my oldest brother to display his artwork.
    * A more complicated portfolio website for my other older brother to display his tattoos.
