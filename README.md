# Websites

* I have some experience in backend work but I'm interested in learning more about the Full-Stack Dev world; particularly, front end. So, I designed, built, and freelanced some websites for friends, family and a startup (caregivr) to get my feet wet. At the moment, my projects include:
  * A landing page for the startup caregivr.
  * A simple portfolio website for my oldest brother to display his artwork.
  * A more complicated portfolio website for my other older brother to display his tattoos.
